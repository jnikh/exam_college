Build a low fidelity wireframe without using any wireframe tools.
Steps:-
Step 1: Open Figma: Launch Figma and create a new project
Step 2: Set up Frame: Create a new frame to represent your design
canvas.


Step 3: Change the page color to any other color as per your likeness,
so that we can see our frame easily without any disruption
Step 4: Basic Shapes: Use simple shapes (rectangles, circles, etc.) to
represent major elements like buttons, images, and text boxes


Step 5: Instead of real content, use lines to represent the text, boxes to
represent background, cross to represent image and so on.
Step 6: Limited Detail: Avoid intricate details at this stage. Focus on
conveying the essential components without getting into specifics.
Step 7: Color Palette: Stick to a grayscale or limited color palette.
